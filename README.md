## Initial Assessment
Uppon initial viewing of the website, I realized the site was not optimized for mobile viewing.

Given the client business and story, along with current trends, it seemed appropriate to address the mobile and small screen presentation of the website as an accessibility issue along with cleaning and reformatting the code for semantics and accessibility.

## Notes on project
I used information from this blog post to create a mobile/small screen friendly menu - https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/create-an-absolute-basic-mobile-css-responsive-navigation-menu

Added link to main logo to return to HOME as is standard.

Repaired Nav link for #SEO section

Altered element tags to use semantic HTML tags for ease of reading.
Commented HTML for ease of reading.
Added alt text for images. > 8600 pixel image for 1700px display. > 7000 pixel image for 300px display, etc.

Consolidated the repetition of CSS properties.
Organized and commented CSS for ease of reading

Resized images for load speeds to aid SEO. Images were dramatically oversized.

**In an effort to improve the mobile presentation of the site, I restructured the HTML/CSS to use flexbox. While maintaining the same large screen appearance as before, the site now gracefully reorganizes for mobile viewing.**
