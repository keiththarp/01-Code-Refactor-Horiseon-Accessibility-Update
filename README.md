# Horiseon-Accessibility-Update
Update Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. for SEO and accessibility standards

Uppon initial audit of the website, I quickly realized that the site was not optimized for mobile viewing. As a matter of fact, it fell apart in a small screen or mobile environment. Given current mobile traffic statistics, this is a huge accessibility issue.
I used information from this blog post to create a mobile/small screen friendly menu - https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/create-an-absolute-basic-mobile-css-responsive-navigation-menu

I also noticed the main logo/text was not linked to return 'Home' or top of page so I added this standard functionality.

Added link for first section #SEO

Consolidated the repetition of class names.

Changed .header class to <header> tag
